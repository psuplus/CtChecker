# Field Sensitive Analysis

## Modular Exponentiation Experiment
If you would like to run the modular exponentiation experiments using this analysis, follow these instructions:

Field-sensitive experiments:
1. Navigate to `mod_exp_tests` folder
2. Run `./runall.sh`

Baseline experiments:
1. Checkout the "baseline" branch
2. Navigate to `mod_exp_tests` folder
3. Run `./runall.sh`

Once the experiments complete, the results are located in `mod_exp_tests/results` folder.
